    Fishing Travel&copy; is a travel agency offering fishing trips all around the globe.
</p>

## Introduction

Fishing Travel, also known as Click-journeY, is a semester-long academic project assigned by CY Tech during the 2024–2025 academic year.</br>
It consists of creating a full-featured web application for a travel agency that offers pre-configured trips with customizable options for each step (accommodation, activities, hostels...).</br>

The project is structured in four functional phases :
- Phase 1 : Front-end development (HTML + CSS)
- Phase 2 : Back-end logic with PHP and data storage (JSONs)
- Phase 3 : JavaScript for dynamic interactions and UX improvements
- Phase 4 : Asynchronous interactions with API Fetch
